First, either download a release zip from the release section, or compile it yourself using the compile.bat file in the repository. Make sure to keep the HLALauncher.jar and hlalauncher.exe files in the same folder at all times. If you downlaoded the zip, take the hlalauncher folder out of it.

2. Put all your map files in the same folder as your HLALauncher.jar and hlalauncher.exe files
3. Run the jar file, select your map, and click the button at the bottom
4. If asked, enter your install location for Half-Life: Alyx (eg. C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life Alyx) without quotes or a slash at the end
5. Enjoy!

### Drag and Drop\:

1. Drag your map file onto hlalauncher.exe
2. If asked, enter your install location for Half-Life: Alyx (eg. C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life Alyx) without quotes or a slash at the end
3. Enjoy!

## Q and A\:
Q\: Why does this seem so unfinished?

A\: Because it is. I plan on adding many more features to this as time goes on. Future planned changes include cleaning up the code (sorry it's a mess), a better gui, possibly adding file association for vpks, and much more.
